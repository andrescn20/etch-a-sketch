What is this?
Simple "painting" game where you use the mouse pointer to hover over a grid. Eery hovered square will change its color depending on the function that was selected. It can paint in black, random or white. Remember its hovering and not clicking what changes the color, so you'll have to be creative in how you move your mouse.
